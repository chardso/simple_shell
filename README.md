# Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:
**<li>Everything you need to know about to start coding your own shell</li>** 
https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/64</li>
**<li>Approaching the project</li>**

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

# General

<li>Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system</li>
<li>Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell</li>
<li>Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)</li>
<li>Who is Ken Thompson</li>
<li>How does a shell work</li>
<li>What is a pid and a ppid</li>
<li>How to manipulate the environment of the current process</li>
<li>What is the difference between a function and a system call</li>
<li>How to create processes</li>
What are the three prototypes of main
<li>How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs</li>
<li>How to execute another program with the execve system call</li>
<li>How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates</li>
<li>What is EOF / “end-of-file”?</li>

# how to built a simple shell.

## compilation

<li>Your shell will be compiled this way:</li>

<li>gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh</li>
